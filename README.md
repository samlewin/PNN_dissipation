# Probablistic neural networks for predicting energy dissipation rates in geophysical turbulent flows

This repository is the official implementation of the paper `Probablistic neural networks for predicting energy dissipation rates in geophysical turbulent flows'

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements are best installed in a Python 3 virtual environment.

## Training

To train the PNN described in the paper, run this command:

```train
python3 train_model.py 
```

## Testing

To test the model on the included test dataset, run:

```eval
python test_model.py 
```

## Pre-trained Models

A pre-trained model model_shearr_mixed_all.h5 is included in the repository.
